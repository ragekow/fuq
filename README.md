# Fast Upload Query

## So how do I use this thing?

Well, it's a "pastebin" self-hosted clone in PHP. Styling is Tailwind. I'm testing with MySQL.

### What you need to know.
1. db.php stores the db connection info.
2. register_process.php stores a secret phrase, used during registration to permit successful registration.
